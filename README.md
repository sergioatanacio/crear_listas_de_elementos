# Create ists and items

A simple php application, which works on the desktop. And that allows you to create lists of tasks and what you need. It is written in php.

## Facility
To install and run it, you must first install xammp https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html.

After installed, you download the code from this repository as a zip. And you put it in the htdocs folder (C:\xampp\htdocs\) there you unzip it. Then go into the unzipped folder (create_item_lists-main) and you will find a file that says create_item_list.html.
You create a shortcut of this file on the desktop and that's it.

## Run the program
To run the program, open the xammp control panel in the start menu, and start the apache server by clicking start on the apache side.

Then you double click on the desktop icon and voila.
